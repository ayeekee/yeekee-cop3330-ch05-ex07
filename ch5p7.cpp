/* 
    Quadratic equations [calculator]
    There is a problem, though: if b2â€“4ac is less than zero, then it will fail. Write a program that can calculate x for a
    quadratic equation. Create a function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b, c. When the program
    detects an equation with no real roots, have it print out a message. How do you know that your 
    results are plausible? Can you check that they are correct?
